#1	Give the suffix array of "banana$". Return your answer as a list of integers separated by spaces (e.g., 0 1 2 3 4).
	6 5 3 1 0 4 2

#2	A key feature of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform is that it transforms runs into repeats.
	False

#3	Find the Burrows-Wheeler transform of Text = TCAGGGCTTG$.
	GCTGTGGA$TC

#4	If BWT(Text) = TTCCATTGGA$, what is Text?
	TGTACCATGT$ -- sanity check: True

#5	Which of the following structures did we use in this chapter to decrease memory when solving the Multiple Pattern Matching Problem with the Burrows-Wheeler transform? (Select all that apply.)
	[True]	checkpoint arrays
	[True]	partial suffix arrays
	[False]	breakpoint graphs
	[False]	de Bruijn graphs

#6	Say that you know that two strings of length n=363 match with at most d=5 mismatches, but you do not know what the strings are.
	What is the largest value of k such that we can guarantee that the two strings share a k-mer?
	k=floor(n/(d+1))=60
