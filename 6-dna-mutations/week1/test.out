#1	The most efficient way to map reads to a reference genome is by using global alignment to align each read to the reference genome.
	False
#2	What is the runtime of BruteForcePatternMatching? n = |text| and m = |pattern|
	Worst case is when you have m=1, O(nm)
	Note: Best case is when you have m=n, O(m)
#3	Which patterns could have been used to construct the following trie? (Select all that apply.)
	[True]	dale
	[True]	bandana
	[False]	banana
	[False]	danny
#4	Given the following suffix trie/suffix tree of an unknown text, identify all starting positions in the underlying text of
	Pattern = "na". Use 0-based indexing and enter the starting positions as space-separated integers in increasing order.
	Text: "adnaadnanadadnan$" (|Text|=16) has starting positions [2, 6, 8, 13] for "na"
#5	How many leaves will SuffixTree("AAATCCCCCCCTCGCGACTTCTAGAGAAGAAGAGTACT$") have?
	#39 leafs
