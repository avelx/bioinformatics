#1	The most efficient way to map reads to a reference genome is by using global alignment to align each read to the reference genome.
	False
#2	What is the runtime of BruteForcePatternMatching? n = |text| and m = |pattern|
	Worst case is when you have m=1, O(nm)
	Note: Best case is when you have m=n, O(m)
#3	Which patterns could have been used to construct the following trie? (Select all that apply.)
	[True]	can
	[True]	banal
	[False]	ananas
	[False]	danny
#4	Given the following suffix trie/suffix tree of an unknown text, identify all starting positions in the underlying text of
	Pattern = "dna". Use 0-based indexing and enter the starting positions as space-separated integers in increasing order.
	Text: "danaadnanadadnan$" has starting positions [5, 12] for "dna"
#5	How many leaves will SuffixTree("TCTGAGCCCTACTGTCGAGAAATATGTATCTCGCCCCCGCAGCTT$") have?
	#46 leafs
